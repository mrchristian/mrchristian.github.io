    "text": "Profile\nSimon’s work has been dedicated to lowering barriers to publishing and reading of scholarly works through developing free and open source software to disintermediate current publishers workflows by introducing efficiency, automation, and interoperability.\nInitially in 2005 the focus of the software investigation was single source to multi-format typesetting and more recently: microservices, content real-time validation with Continuous Integration (CI), Infrastructure as code (IasC), and increasing interoperability with the implementation of frameworks such as the JATS standard — Manuscript Exchange Common Approach (MECA). See: https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/meca.\nSkill sets: Software product owner → Full-stack web developer → UX/UI design research and visual design → Research team leader → Publisher & editor → Open Science & FOSS advocate → Publishing company founder & director → Serial startup founder."
